;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs has a problem when displaying very long lines: it becomes unusable slow.
;; This global minor mode works around this problem by hiding very long lines and
;; replacing them with only a few of their first characters and a little info
;; blurp about how many characters were hidden.

;; It works adding the function too-long-lines-hide into the find-file-hook so that
;; it is called as soon as a file is opened.

;; too-long-lines-hide goes through all lines in a buffer, checks if the line
;; is longer then too-long-lines-threshold and if it is, it creates an overlay
;; with the lines replacement in its 'display property that is then displayed
;; instead of the very long line.

;; To use this mode just require this file, configure too-long-lines-threshold
;; and too-long-lines-show-number-of-characters to your pleasing and call
;; too-long-lines-mode to enable the mode globally.

;;; Code:
(defvar too-long-lines-threshold 10000
  "The threshold after which `too-long-lines-hide' cuts of a line and hides the rest.")

(defvar too-long-lines-show-number-of-characters 30
  "How many characters of a line remain shown after it is hidden.")

(defvar too-long-lines-hide-current-timer nil
  "The current timer for `too-long-lines-run-with-idle-timer-in-special-buffers'.

Do not set this manually, use `too-long-lines-idle-seconds' to specify the
idle seconds after which `too-long-lines-run-with-idle-timer-in-special-buffers'
runs `too-long-lines-hide'.")

(defvar too-long-lines-idle-seconds 3
  "Set this to how many seconds emacs should be idle before
`too-long-lines-run-with-idle-timer-in-special-buffers' runs `too-long-lines-hide'.")

(defvar too-long-lines-special-buffer-modes '(shell-mode)
  "The modes which `too-long-lines-run-with-idle-timer-in-special-buffers' recognizes
as special buffers in which `too-long-lines-hide' should be run periodically.")

(defvar too-long-lines-toggle-key (kbd "TAB"))

(defun too-long-lines-hide (&optional beg end len)
  "Hides lines that are longer then `too-long-lines-threshold'.

It replaces too long lines with the first N number characters of the line as
configured in variable `too-long-lines-show-number-of-characters', and a little
info blurp about how many characters were hidden.
